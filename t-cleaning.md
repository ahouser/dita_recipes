# How to Clean the Kitchen

Here's how to properly clean up the kitchen after making breakfast so your roommates don't think you're a slob. 

1. Put away food in the pantry and fridge where you found it
2. Place dirty dishes and tools you used to cook with in the dishwasher
    * **Note**: certain pots and pans may not fit in the dishwasher and may need to be hand washed. Place these on the drying mat when finished
3. Wipe down the counters with a sponge
